        <p>
            I finished a bachelor's degree in 2010 in music performance and have been singing classical music ever since. 
            In 2022, I decided to enroll in a bootcamp for software development. In October, I received a
            certificate in full-stack software engineering from Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis.
            Prime was excellent because it offered an in-person 20-week program with outstanding placement rates
            and income improvement for graduates.

            I'm still looking for my first job and will update here when that changes. Wish me luck!
